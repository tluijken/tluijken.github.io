# About Me

Hello, welcome to my blog! My name is Thomas Luijken, and I'm a 38-year-old
Business Unit Manager at [Baseflow](https://baseflow.com), leading the
Industrial and Embedded division.

With an extensive background in industrial software development and equally
impressive experience in enterprise software, I've been privileged to work at
the nexus of these two vital domains. My journey through these two spheres has
convinced me of one thing: When married together, they present immense
possibilities for advancement and innovation in the industrial software
engineering sector.

## My Work

At [Baseflow](https://baseflow.com), we’re passionate about creating software
solutions that have a meaningful impact. As the head of the 'Industrial and
Embedded' unit, my role is to oversee the development of reliable and
high-quality industrial software. I believe that the best results emerge from a
combination of practical and theoretical knowledge, alongside a deep
understanding of the user's needs.

## My Expertise

Over the years, I've gained a wealth of experience in:

- Industrial software development
- Enterprise software design and architecture
- Managing teams and projects
- Digital transformation strategies
- Industry 4.0 and IoT

## A Bit About Me Personally

When I'm not deeply involved in managing or contributing to industrial software
projects, you can often find me indulging in two of my biggest passions: Riding
motorcycles and enjoying heavy music. The freedom and exhilaration I experience
on a motorcycle ride and the energy I derive from heavy music are unparalleled.
These pursuits not only keep me grounded but also continually inspire me in my
professional work.

## Connect With Me

I'm always eager to connect and engage with other professionals and enthusiasts
in the field. Feel free to reach out to me through:

engaging.
