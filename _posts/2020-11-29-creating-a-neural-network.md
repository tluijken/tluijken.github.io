## Introduction
These days, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are playing a major role in our software. Big tech companies like Microsoft and Google made API's available to us, which allows us to easily embed machine learning into or software, without diving deep into the nerdy stuff. But, there are developers like me, who like the nerdy stuff. I want to know, in the basics how this stuff works. Start small, and understand the process of machine learning, rather than just consuming a public API and shouting out loud 'we use AI!' as a commercial trademark. 

In this article I'll explain how to build a neural network from scratch, and configure it to perform a simple XOR like operation. I won't go into too much detail on the types of machine learning, but I'll provide resources as much as possible. There is so much information regarding this on the internet, written by people who have more knowledge regarding this topic than I have.

### Short introduction to neural networks
Machine learning can be done using neural networks. A neural network in software can be seen as the neural network in our brain. Our brain consists of [**neurons**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron), which are connected through [**Synapsys**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse). A group of connected neurons can be called a [**neural network**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network).
